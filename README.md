Ride sharing for Outside Lands!

Outside Rides saves you time and money by providing a platform to sync up with those heading in the same direction. Simply click on map pins to see where others are going, or post your own ride if you already have one arranged. When you open the application, you will be asked to enter your phone number so other users can contact you when they tap on your pin. If you have a ride, tap on the “Post Your Ride” button to enter your destination and number of seats. A pin will be created on the map, indicating your current location so other users close to you can find someone to leave quickly with. If you do not have a ride, tap on any pin to figure out where that person is heading and be given the option to call them if you are going to the same area.
